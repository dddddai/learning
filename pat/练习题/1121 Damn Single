“Damn Single (单身狗)” is the Chinese nickname for someone who is being single. 
You are supposed to find those who are alone in a big party, so they can be taken care of.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=50000), 
the total number of couples. Then N lines of the couples follow, 
each gives a couple of ID’s which are 5-digit numbers (i.e. from 00000 to 99999). 
After the list of couples, there is a positive integer M (<=10000) followed by M ID’s of the party guests.
The numbers are separated by spaces. 
It is guaranteed that nobody is having bigamous marriage (重婚) or dangling with more than one companion.

Output Specification:

First print in a line the total number of lonely guests. Then in the next line,
print their ID’s in increasing order. The numbers must be separated by exactly 1 space, 
and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.
