If a machine can save only 3 significant digits, 
the float numbers 12300 and 12358.9 are considered equal since they are both saved as 0.123*105 with simple chopping.
Now given the number of significant digits on a machine and two float numbers, you are supposed to tell if they are treated equal in that machine.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives three numbers N, A and B, 
where N (<100) is the number of significant digits, and A and B are the two float numbers to be compared. 
Each float number is non-negative, no greater than 10100, and that its total digit number is less than 100.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in a line “YES” if the two numbers are treated equal, 
and then the number in the standard form “0.d1…dN*10^k” (d1>0 unless the number is 0); 
or “NO” if they are not treated equal, and then the two numbers in their standard form. 
All the terms must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of a line.

Note: Simple chopping is assumed without rounding.

Sample Input 1:
3 12300 12358.9

Sample Output 1:
YES 0.123*10^5


Sample Input 2:
3 120 128

Sample Output 2:
NO 0.120*10^3 0.128*10^3
