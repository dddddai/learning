The task is simple: given any positive integer N, 
you are supposed to count the total number of 1's in the decimal form of the integers from 1 to N.
For example, given N being 12, there are five 1's in 1, 10, 11, and 12.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives the positive N (â‰¤2^30)
Output Specification:

For each test case, print the number of 1's in one line.


Sample Input:
12

Sample Output:
5




#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    int result=0;
    for(int div=1;div<=n;div*=10){
        int a=n/div;
        int b=n%div;
        result+=(a+8)/10*div;
        if(a%10==1){
            result+=b+1;
        }
    }
    cout<<result;
    return 0;
}
